# Elliptic Curve Addition

## Introduction
A web application that gets data through a form to realise different operations on an elliptic curve (currenlty doing only addition in R). 

## Technology
This application is built with Python, Flask, and Matplotlib.

## Interface Preview
WIP

## Demo
WIP

## TO DO
Tabs to add:
1. draw an elliptic curve and compare to other elliptic curves that can be drawn over
2. determine if a point is on a curve and if not recommend points (prob the ones with the same X or Y or the closest one)
3. addition in R - Done
4. multiplication in R
5. addition in Fp
6. multiplication in Fp
