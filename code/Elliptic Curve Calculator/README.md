# Elliptic Curve Calculator

## Introduction
A web application that gets data through a form to realise different operations on Elliptic Curves over Finite Fields. 

## Technology
This application is built with Python, Flask, Matplotlib and Bootstrap.

## Operations
1. Addition in R and Fp
2. Multiplication in R and Fp
3. Normal and Improved ECDH key exchange
4. Normal and Improved Elliptic ElGamal Cryptosistem
5. ECDSA
6. Time to break ECDLP
7. Simulate ECDLP attack
8. Order of point P in E(Fp)
9. Order of Elliptic Curve over Fp
10. Generate random Elliptic Curve over Fp
